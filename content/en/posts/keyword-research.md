so far you have seen some keyword suggestions about our seed keyword term **Email Marketing** you can choose any keyword with low difficulty. If you do not find any low-difficulty keywords then copy any given keyword and use it as a seed keyword and repeat the same process until you find the desired keyword.

apart from this, there are some other terms which we need to know 

### Keyword Density

The total number of times you use a keyword in your content. This used to be a big keyword ranking factor in previous years but doesnâ€™t hold monumental importance these days.

### Focus Keyword (Main Keyword)

The focus keyword is the main keyword you want to target on your page. The key to rank your content for the focus keyword is to ensure that your content justifies and covers all the important points related to it.

### Keyword Gap

The keyword gap is the difference between your keywords and your competitorsâ€™ keywords. Keyword gap analysis is one of the most important parts of competitorsâ€™ keyword research.Â 

### Keyword Ranking

The position for which your page is ranking on the SERPs for a certain keyword.

### Keyword Value (in CPC)

Keyword value shows the potential of the traffic that comes through that keyword. It is measured in CPC (Cost-Per-Click). The value can certainly differ (at times to a large extent) from tool to tool.

### Question Keywords

You will hardly see this term being used I use it to define the keywords that are in the form of questions. 

These keywords generally have the highest potential and clearest intent as the users are looking for very specific answers when they search for these keywords. How to search for them and use them in your content is discussed in the latter part of this guide.

You can clearly see the question keyword in the below screenshot.

### Longtail Keywords

While there is no standard word count, we consider that keywords four or more words long can be considered as longtail keywords. 

Though the search volume for these keywords is usually pretty low, they are VERY specific. The potential they have for conversions and attracting highly relevant traffic is way greater than shorter, general keywords with large search volumes.

You can clearly see the longtail keyword in the above screenshot.

### User Intent for a Keyword

In simple words, user intent for a keyword is what a user expects to see in the search results when they search for that keyword.

### Keyword Stuffing

The practice of overusing a keyword in an unnatural way throughout a piece of content is known as keyword stuffing. 

Keyword stuffing used to work in the early days of SEO, but that all changed after a series of major Google Algorithm Updates. These days, your content can be penalized for keyword stuffing. Here is what [Google considers as keyword stuffing](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358?hl=en)

## Key Factors to Look for While Performing Keyword Research

Apart from following the keyword research best practices, we also need to look for various factors to make sure that the keywords which you search for SEO are effective. Here are the factors which you should look for.

### Check the Keyword Search Volume

Search volume is the total number of searches users make for a keyword in the specified time. The greater the search volume, the more potential it has to generate traffic to your content. Even though search volume is important, it should not be the only priority while doing keyword research for SEO.

### CPC Value of Keyword

CPC (Cost-Per-Click) value determines the value and competition for a keyword to some extent. Keywords with high CPC value are generally tough to rank for. But, they can bring in highly relevant traffic with a good chance of conversions.

### Understand the User Intent of a keyword

To understand the user intent for a keyword, you can make an assessment by simply doing a Google Search for that keyword. Check out the types of results you get and look for patterns in the search results. The type of results you get in SERP will help you in understanding the user intent for that keyword.

### Goals

What do you want to achieve through your keyword search? Building traffic, generating leads, generating sales, etc. Your goal matters very much for the keyword research and analysis you conduct â€“ the search intent of a user will need to match.

### Types of Pages

The impact of a keyword differs from page to page. A keyword with purchase intent (i.e. Buy or Pricing) will not work well on an informational blog post and vice versa.

Many of the tools listed below can help you analyze other aspects of your websiteâ€™s performance, not just keywords. But even if youâ€™re just looking at keyword data, these tools can give you information like search volume, ranking difficulty (useful for content strategy and SEO), keyword value (useful for pay per click advertising), competition and more.
